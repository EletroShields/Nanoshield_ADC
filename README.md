==============

This is the Arduino software library to access the ADC Nanoshield (ADS1x15 IC).

The ADC Nanoshield offers a solution for applications that need analog to digital conversion with higher resolution or when the number of analog inputs of your MCU isn't enough.

To install, just copy it under &lt;arduinosketchfolder&gt;/libraries/

This library is based on the [Adafruit_ADS1X15](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_ADS1X15) library from Adafruit.
